# Audio Assets

Place your audio files here:

- backtrack1.mp4
- backtrack2.mp4
- backtrack3.mp4
- spin-tick.mp3 (optional, for wheel ticking sound)

Notes:
- Filenames must match exactly; formats can be `.mp3` or `.mp4` depending on your sources. If you use other formats, update `index.html` accordingly.
- The Start button plays `backtrack1` then `backtrack2`, then `backtrack3` which loops continuously.
- If `spin-tick.mp3` is present, the wheel plays a short tick during spins.
